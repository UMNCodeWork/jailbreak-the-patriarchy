"Jailbreak the Patriarchy"
--------------------------

Principles for inclusive tech spaces
====================================

1. Ask questions without self-judgement; and don't judge others for asking questions--they're helping you, too!

2. Just because someone asks a question, don't assume they know NOTHING--don't overcompensate

3. Explaining technical things is a little like "consent": ask how much explanation they want, don't assume they know nothing or everything--keep a conversation around it

Grace Hopper conference session made a distinction between:
Egalitarian communication ~= inclusive communication
negative liberty to participate vs. positive liberty to participate

Random question:
What will we do with AI beings?  Will they be gendered?  Can we un-gender them?  (Look at Wall-E, for example.)


Oppressive assumptions men have for men in tech spaces
======================================================
* Everyone likes pizza and beer!
* Everyone plays video games
* Everyone likes a competition
* "Who's the next Steve Jobs?" - cult of exceptionalism (and individualism)


Unique characteristics/advantages of women-only tech spaces
===========================================================
* Collaborative
* Turn-taking conversation (not interrupting)
* Credit sharing (not credit-taking)
* Default mode is to undersell your tech capabilities (whereas men, if they take one Codecademy course, they "know Ruby")
* How do we feel about the word "Girl"? "female" as a noun (vs. an adjective).  Maybe "Gal" as a good alternative to mean "women of any age"...


Disciplinary vs. Algorithmic thinking
=====================================
Traditional tech/science disciplines may have a bias against interdisciplinarity

"Disciplinary thinking" may be more satisfied with "not knowing" (epistemic uncertainty and unfulfilment)
"Algorithmic thinking" doesn't settle as well for "not knowing" and not converging on a "solution"

Interesting cross spaces to explore:
* Pappert as a good example of making code about *expression*, not just *problem-solving*
* Literate programming
* Pamela Fox
